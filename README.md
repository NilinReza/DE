Dewan Enterprise Database - UNFINISHED
A simple GUI application that utilises HSQL and takes in data using .txt files. 
Made as a side project to help an enterprise (Dewan Enterprise) move from paper-based database to a computerized database.
Has mock data .txt files to simulate the clients, all the items in the inventory of a shop and memos.
The program uses a simple GUI implemented by Java Swing GUI, admin needs to login with set credentials before they can make changes to the data through the program. 
Add new client/item/memo do not work, needs to be implemented.
Show all clients/items/memos work, can be viewed in 3 different frames at the same time or admin can change to 1 frame at a time only to make sure there is only one window open at any given time, this option can be toggled by a checkbox right below the Show all clients/items/memos button and right beside the Add new client/item/memo button.
